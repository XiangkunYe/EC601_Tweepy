# EC601_Tweepy

Hello! I'm Xiangkun Ye and I write this tweepy project for EC601 Miniproject1.

As you can see, there're three files in the repository.

You can use get_tweet_pic.py directly and input the id of that guy you want to download picture from. Or use it as API, import it and use the get_tweet_pic fiction.

For pic2mp4.py, it could be use to invert jpg to mp4.

About GoogleVision.py, you can use it to analyze all jpg in your current working directory, or use it as API. Be care that you may need to use 

export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/Users/yxk/Documents/Python/601/GoogleVisionKey.json" 

first, change it into your own directory.

Have fun with them! If you find any bugs, please tell me, if you are professor or TA, please give me a good grade!
