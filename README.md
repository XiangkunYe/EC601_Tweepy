# EC601_Tweepy

Hello! I'm Xiangkun Ye and I write this tweepy project for EC601 Miniproject1.

You can use main.py to finish the whole download-analysis-convert process just by inputing the id and tweet number.

## But remember to:

  Install tweepy, ffmpeg and Pillow.
  
  Change the consumer_key/_secret, access_key/_secret, GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS into your own.
  
If you use it as a normal .py file, it will run automatically, if you want to use it as API, there're three functions:

  get_tweet_pic, analypic, pic2mp4
  
Have fun with them! If there's any bug, please tell me, if you're professor or TA, please give me a good grade!
